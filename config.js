            description: 'Access to healthcare is one of UN SGDs. In Africa, access to healthcare is one of the many challenges of health systems of many countries.  Road accidents are one of the most frequent cases in the emergency rooms in hospitals in most parts of Nigeria (Ogunmola et al, 2013). Nigeria is no different.  In this showcase, we ask "How easy is it to access healthcare after getting into an accident in Lagos?". We explore the road accident deaths in Lagos, health facilities in the state, routes that are closest to the health facilities and the fastest ways to access the health facilities in the case of an accident.',
